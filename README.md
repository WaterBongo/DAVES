# DAVES: The AI Safety Assistant

DAVES (Digital Assistant for Virtual Environment Safety) is a Safety assistant that runs off of a powerful AI. Using advanced natural language processing and machine learning, DAVES has learned to detect keywords and patterns that indicate dangerous situations. DAVES will take the necessary steps required to keep you safe!

## Key Features

* Monitoring online conversations in real time
* Does not affect computer speeds
* Detects patterns and keywords that indicate danger
* Immediate response to potential danger
* Easy to setup and use for your online experience

## Inspiration

When I was almost 10-11, I remember talking to all of my school friends about messaging. They would brag about that fact that their parents did not watch them while they were on the computer. I also remember talking to some suspicious people online. At the ages of 10-13, your brain is easily influenced, allowing people to put bad thoughts in your head. This two ideas got me thinking about staying safe online, which inspired this project.

## Challenges

For us, the biggest time constraint was most definitely the 1-2 day total work time that we had to create a working application. Usually, if we are not restricted by time, we are able to easily create a platform that suits our needs. However, since we only had about 1.5 DAYS to create our application, we had to be mindful of our time. Another challenge we faced was creating the front end. None of our team knew how to code Javascript, style with CSS and code in HTML. However, I learned some average javascript skills and created the website in a day.

## What we learned

When me and my team started coding DAVES, all of us has learned different things. For example, Orion, one of our members, learned how to interact with the discord api! As for me, I learned how to interact with natural language processing models. I've worked with ai before, but never have I worked with NLP. And last but not least, Rohan, our last teammate, learned how to edit videos that describe our program well.

## How we built this project

* Flask for backend
* HTML for frontend
* CSS for website styling
* HuggingFace transformer for NLP
